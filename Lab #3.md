## Lab #3

For this lab, we needed to review the notes on Python, install the relevant pacakges (jdcal, astral and geopy), and then follow with specific commands.   

I previously had Python installed on my laptop, but I ran into some issues when I had to install the packages. I realized that an update was the best option.
