# Practice
## This is a space for me to practice what I learn in EE 322

***Things that I learned:***  
* When you create a file, you must include the file extension .md to create a file written in Markdown  
* Also, to make a new line, add two spaces after the previous line  

_These are some useful links:_ :smiley:
