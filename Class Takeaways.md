**Learning** - There are 86 billion neurons in our brain. When we learn something new, we need to relate it to something that we already know. By making these connections, we grok it, and we are sure to remember since it becomes a part of us. Our brain forms new neural pathways and connections so that you are more likely to remember this new information.  

**Burning Question** - With the advancement of AI in every industry, how do you see it being applied to Power Engineering? And how soon? Based on my summer 2024 internship, I am trying to see what other subfield on electrical engineering what complement my main concentration.   

**What I am hoping to gain from this course** - Aspects of engineering and technology that I've always wanted to explore e.g. Raspberry Pi and GitHub, but I've never really known where to begin because of the vast range of resources. It seemed very overwhelming starting from scratch so up until this point I've limited myself in my learning and knowledge.  

I've used Raspberry Pi and Linux in my past summer 2023 research, but I had to jump right into the middle of the project. I received guidelines specific to the research project, but I never really had the foundation and background to learn the fundamentals.

BLUF - Bottom Line Up Front  
* When you are sending an email, clearly state your point first in the email, then provide more details after.

Communication  
* Communication is key as an engineer. This also deals with how you present yourself in a meeting. For instance, you want to have your name tag in line of sight as the hand that you shake with.

Pomodoro Technique
* Our attention span lasts for about 25 minutes, so that is when we are most effective.
* After that interval, take some time to diffuse and step away, then return with a fresh and focused mind.

Metcalfe's Law  
* We learn from one another.

System vs Process
* A system depicts how things are configured and describes how things relate to one another. It describes the functional aspect of something.
* A process outlines the steps and it describes the operational aspect of something.  

Etymology  
* Every word has an origin and foundation.
* e.g. Engineering --> engineer --> engine
* e.g. Okta is an engineering unit

Success  
* You shouldn't define or measure your success based on external rewards.
* Rather, evaluate how the things you are doing bring internal meaning to you.

Digital Twin
* Cyber model of the physical system

Inclusive Design: Put others first (empathy) - if you only focus on yourself, you cater to your needs only and the market size is just yourself.   

Three Cs Mindset:
1. Curiosity
2. Connections
3. Creating Value   

Three Types of Problems: 
1. Explanation
2. Prediction
3. Invention

Hindsight, Insight, Foresight, Oversight

Grit
* Etymology - sandpaper
* Mindset - persevering; when the going gets tough, the tough get going

Engineering is always an iterative process; focus on others and focus on function

Kepner-Tregoe (KT) situation analysis

Duncker Diagram
* Don't start with the solution
* Start with the present and desired states
* Come up with several solutions

IEEE Format
* Fig.1. (then capitalize the first word, and end with a period)
* TABLE I (use of Roman numerals, then the caption is on the line below, capitalized as well. The table itself then comes below)   

Abstractions:
* Occam's Razor and KISS Principle: It is always best to keep things simple
* Goldilocks Principle: Not too much or not too little

Formality in the Professional World   
* The senior person should initiate the handshake. If they don't, then it is not necessary to shake their hand. Also, keep the handshake simple: one handshake.

A picture is worth one thousand words:   
* Visio
* Unified Modeling Language (UML) software
* Mermaid AI

System vs Process   
* A system shows the components and how they work together
* A process shows step by step (flowchart)

Serendipity:
* A fortunate outcome for a prepared mind: "In the fields of observation, chance favors only the prepared mind"

Synthesis:   
* Synthesis - putting things together; it is qualitative   
* Analysis - the opposite of synthesis; it is quantitative   
* Morphological Analysis - qualitative   

Tacit/Explicit:   
* Tacit: when you internalize something, it is implicit. It only becomes explicit when you tell someone else   
* Richard Feynman - learning by teaching

Setting SMART goals:   
* Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound

Personal Wellbeing, MAGIC:   
* Mindful, Active, Generous, Interested, Connected

Pomodoro Technique:
* Focus for 25 minutes, take a 5 minute break, and repeat   
* Focus and Diffuse

Ethics vs Morals
* Ethics is a process and it is recognised by a group   
* Morals are based on an individual's assessment of what is right and wrong

In automated systems, always leave room for human intervention
To find the root cause of a problem, always ask why

### 11/18/2024
Remember that "shall" is used for requirements, and "should" is for objectives - this needs to be 'soldered' and 'embedded' in our minds!
Design is an iterative process

Selection Bias - In a group, different team members may have different perspectives   
Heuristics

Duck Curve - useful in solar 
Solar Power Tower - Seville, Spain

Qunatitative 
* Rank Ordering
* Weighting Factor
* Rating
* Use the morphological chart for the design alternatives

Low-hanging Fruit:
* When you have little motivation to do something, but it needs to be done, it might be helpful to start with those tasks that are easy to accomplish.
* This is useful in your professional career as well.

Useful resources going into Senior Design:   
* [ECE Senior Design Site](https://sites.google.com/view/ece423)
* Innovation Expo 2025: Canavan / May 9th   
* [Capstone Marketplace](https://sercuarc.org/capstone-marketplace/)   
* You need to be enrolled in your specific major's senior design class: EE 423/424, even if you are in an interdisciplinary team

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)   

Mean time between failures (MTBF):The expected time between two failures of a repairable system   
Mean time to failure (MTTF): The expected time to failire for a non-repairable system   
Mean downtime (MDT):The mean time that the system is down after the failure

User Experience (UX):   
There are different types of testing:   
* Alpha Testing: Internal testing
* Beta Testing: Testing is opened up to the public. External users test a refined version of the product   
* A/B Testing - Users choose either option A or B

Test Criteria:   
A system consists of several modules or units
* Unit Testing - Testing each individual module separately and independently
* System Testing - All the units are integrated and the system is tested as a whole

Energy Conservation:
Most of our designs are digital - therefore, you don't need to continuously check for something, but rather, do this in fixed intervals. e.g. a system recording the temperature of the environment every 5 minutes
