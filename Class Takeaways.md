**Learning** - There are 86 billion neurons in our brain. When we learn something new, we need to relate it to something that we already know. By making these connections, we grok it, and we are sure to remember since it becomes a part of us. Our brain forms new neural pathways and connections so that you are more likely to remember this new information.  

**Burning Question** - With the advancement of AI in every industry, how do you see it being applied to Power Engineering? And how soon? Based on my summer 2024 internship, I am trying to see what other subfield on electrical engineering what complement my main concentration.   

**What I am hoping to gain from this course** - Aspects of engineering and technology that I've always wanted to explore e.g. Raspberry Pi and GitHub, but I've never really known where to begin because of the vast range of resources. It seemed very overwhelming starting from scratch so up until this point I've limited myself in my learning and knowledge.  

I've used Raspberry Pi and Linux in my past summer 2023 research, but I had to jump right into the middle of the project. I received guidelines specific to the research project, but I never really had the foundation and background to learn the fundamentals.

BLUF - Bottom Line Up Front  
* When you are sending an email, clearly state your point first in the email, then provide more details after.

Communication  
* Communication is key as an engineer. This also deals with how you present yourself in a meeting. For instance, you want to have your name tag in line of sight as the hand that you shake with.

Pomodoro Technique
* Our attention span lasts for about 25 minutes, so that is when we are most effective.
* After that interval, take some time to diffuse and step away, then return with a fresh and focused mind.

Metcalfe's Law  
* We learn from one another.

System vs Process
* A system depicts who things are configured and describes how things relate to one another. It describes the functional aspect of something.
* A process outlines the steps and it describes the operational aspect of something.  

Etymology  
* Every word has an origin and foundation.
* e.g. Engineering --> engineer --> engine
* e.g. Okta is an engineering unit

Success  
* You shouldn't define or measure your success based on external rewards.
* Rather, evaluate how the things you are doing bring internal meaning to you.

Digital Twin
* Cyber model of the physical system

Grit
* Etymology - sandpaper
* Mindset - persevering; when the going gets tough, the tough get going

Engineering is always an iterative process; focus on others and focus on function

Kepner-Tregoe (KT) situation analysis

Duncker Diagram
* Don't start with the solution
* Start with the present and desired states
* Come up with several solutions
